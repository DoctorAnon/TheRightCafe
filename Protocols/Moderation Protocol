üî® MODERATION PROTOCOL üî®

1Ô∏è‚É£ Unless you are an Administrator you are NOT an interpreter of the #rules. Rules are to be enforced as written. Janitors/Moderators enforce server rules and personal motives should never influence your moderative judgement. You are to be OBJECTIVE not SUBJECTIVE. Even if you agree with what someone is saying but they violated a rule, you are to enforce the rules.

2Ô∏è‚É£ You have an incredibly useful and wide-reaching tool at your disposal. The Detainment system. There are 2 primary channels related to this system, they are #detained and #paperwork. The detainment system is meant to isolate a user to a single channel ( #detained ) in which you can keep them there as punishment AND/OR explain to them what they did wrong. The commands you need to know for this system are as follows:
?detain @user [reason] | This command will detain the selected @user to the detained channel. ALWAYS include a reason for detainment!
?release @user | This command will release a user from detained back into the main server chats.
?undetain @user | Same as ?release

3Ô∏è‚É£ If you see a new account, detain & question them as to why their account is new. If they claim their account was recently deleted - ask them to show a full (not cropped) screenshot of the email which discord sent them about their account being deleted. Their screenshot should, if uncropped, include their time (both on desktop or mobile). Compare that time with your time and see if the minutes match up (i.e if their time is 7:36am, and yours is 2:36pm). If the minutes match up then the screenshot is real. If the minutes do not match up (i.e if their time is 7:36am, and yours is 2:04pm) then it is possible that the screenshot is fake. If you suspect the screenshot of being fake, question further. If they claim this is their first time on discord, be very suspicious. 

4Ô∏è‚É£ If a user you detained/punished complains that what you did was unfair, you must contact a superior who will then make the call. If there are multiple superiors on (e.x you are a Jr, and there is a Officer and Senior Officer online), you must call the one immediately above you (e.x if you are a Junior you call an Officer not a Senior Officer). If there are no superiors on, you may keep them detained until one is on.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Detainment punishments are incredibly simple, when you detain a user simply explain what they did in error and if they are receptive to it and apologize for breaking the rules, they may be released right after. If they are resistant, mock the rules, or other such hoodlum behaviours are presented - you may keep then detained for however long you deem it necessary. If you are unsure as to what to do, always consult a superior officer.
