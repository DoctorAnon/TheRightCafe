☕ __**The Right Cafe, Protocols**__ ☕ 

~~-----------------------------------------------------~~

 ❓ **What are "The Protocols?**
   **-** The Protocols are a set of rules for you as a 
   staff member to follow, they explain how, when to
   and if to do virtually everything in regards to most
   of what you are going to do, such as; Partnerships
   Vetting, Moderation, Polls, QoTD, Testing, etc

~~-----------------------------------------------------~~

 ❓ **So if it's not in the Protocol, I can/can't do it?**
   **-** No, while The Protocols are meant to be as 
   exhaustive as possible, they cannot possibly cover 
   every single edge case or situation. As such, always
   use your common sense along with The Protocols, 
   and if you are unsure - always ask a superior officer.
