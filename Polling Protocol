📊 POLLING PROTOCOL 📊

1️⃣ Only use stock Discord emojis (no nitro/external emojis)

2️⃣ Do NOT use yes/no or extrmely basic emojis such as 👍🏻, ✅, 🙂, etc.

3️⃣ Avoid questions that can be answered with a yes/no

4️⃣ Aim for 4-7 answers for each poll.

5️⃣ The emojis you choose for each answer should be atleast somewhat related, i.e dont use 🤑 emoji for an answer that is “communism good”, use ⚒️ instead

6️⃣ Answers should portray a unique variation of different perspectives, don’t have a question like “whats your view on the minimum wage” and then have your answers be “it should be $9” “it should be $10” “it should be $11” and so on, that is boring and unimaginative. Instead, have answers that offer unique perspectives such as “Set the minimum wage based on education level to encourage higher education”.

7️⃣ Format poll answers with the emoji, a space, an equal sign, a space, and then the answer, with a empty line in between each different answer

8️⃣ Avoid overly specific or obscure topics.

9️⃣ React with the emoji answers to the poll in order, as normal users cannot add reactions themselves, they can only react to reactions already on the message.
