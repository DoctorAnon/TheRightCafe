# TheRightCafe
Repository of guides, protocols, rules, and more related to The Right Cafe.

The Right Cafe was founded in Janurary of 2017, owned by me under various usernames. This resporitory serves as a haven of information I have and have learned to aid you in coming up with ideas in creating your own server.

# Notes:

 **On TRC DynoCustom.txt:**
    Make sure to set the response channel to a seperate channel only mods can see, such as "#paperwork" where the report from the command will post. Also make sure to set the allowed roles, set the command to silent, and to delete the command after being used

 **On Past Polls:**
   These polls should serve as an example on how to make excellent polls, view them in tangent with the POLLS PROTOCOL in the PROTOCOL folder.

 **On Staff Application:**
   The application assumes a singular, uniform staff heirachy, if your staff structure is split into differing teams, adjust the questions accordingly.

 **MOIA/MOP:**
 You will see these 2 acronymns being thrown all over the place, put simply it is a method of dividing a staff team into 2 seperate teams, or "ministries". MOIA is "Ministry of Internal Affairs", which in this case - handles: vetting (if applicable), moderation, QoTD (quetion of the day), Polls, Events, and other various server-related tasks. MOP is "Ministry of Propaganda" which handles chiefly Partnerships, and to a lesser extent, Artwork. Each Ministry is headed by a "Head" and a "Deputy", to ensure that the ministry as a whole is able to run autonomously without intervention from Administrators, this allows the server to continue seemless operation without the Owner or Administrators being present for most of the time.

 **On Rotations:**
  "Rotations" are a guiding hand on who does what, when. In this instance, it is used to determine which staff member is responsible for posting a Question of the Day or a Poll. It is suggested that you orient your rotations in a staggered form. For Instance, on Monday Person A would do QoTD, and Person B would do polls - On Tuesday, Person B does Qotd, and person A would do Polls - on Wedenesday, Person C does Qotd, and Person D does Polls - and so forth. Essentially, just ensure that no one person does multiple rotational tasks on the same day, this ensures both that the individual does not feel overwhelmed or burdened, and it ensures staff feel more engaged with the server thruout the week.

 **On Server AD:**
   It is suggested that when you have an image you want on your partnership ad, that you shorten it using the IMGUR service, upload it to imgur, then once it is uploaded, do not just use the link of the actual post - instead, once it is uploaded, right-click on the image and press "open image link" or something similar, it should then give u a link to just the image itself (e.x: )
