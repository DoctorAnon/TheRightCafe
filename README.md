# TheRightCafe
Repository of guides, protocols, rules, and more related to The Right Cafe.

The Right Cafe was founded in Janurary of 2017, owned by me under various usernames. This resporitory serves as a haven of information I have and have learned to aid you in coming up with ideas in creating your own server.

Notes:
 On TRC DynoCustom.txt:
    Make sure to set the response channel to a seperate channel only mods can see, such as "#paperwork" where the report from the command will post. Also make sure to set the allowed roles, set the command to silent, and to delete the command after being used

 On Previous Polls:
   These polls should serve as an example on how to make excellent polls, view them in tangent with the POLLS PROTOCOL in the PROTOCOL folder.
